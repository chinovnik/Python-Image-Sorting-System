# Python-Image-Sorting-System
A little exif-based image sorting script I wrote in python when I was bored.

I'm not even sure if it works anymore. I sorted several thousand pictures successfully when it did though!

This picture sorting application puts images in folders according to the date they were taken.
Put the .py file in the folder that contains your images and run the script.
This script only works with .jpg and .jpeg images at the moment.
