# Python-Image-Sorting-System
A little exif-based image sorting script I wrote in python when I was bored.

I was in the process of reworking it to be able to sort images and videos of almost any format, but never got around to finishing it.
In the brief time that it did work, it successfully sorted and organized several thousand pictures for me, quite quickly.

Maybe I'll get around to finishing it one day...

This picture sorting application puts images in folders according to the date they were taken.
Put the .py file in the folder that contains your images and run the script.
This script only works with .jpg and .jpeg images at the moment.
